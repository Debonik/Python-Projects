# Detailed Line-By-Line Explanation of Subdomain Finder Code

## Importing the Library

```python
import requests
```

- **What It Does**: This line brings in a helper tool called `requests` that knows how to talk to websites.

## Defining the Function

```python
def find_subdomains(domain, wordlist):
```

- **What It Does**: This line says we're making a new tool (a function) called `find_subdomains`. This tool needs two things to work: a main website name (`domain`) and a list of common sub-website names (`wordlist`).

## Initializing an Empty List

```python
    found_subdomains = []
```

- **What It Does**: This line makes an empty box (`list`) where we'll put the names of sub-websites we find.

## Looping Through the Wordlist

```python
    for sub in wordlist:
```

- **What It Does**: This line starts a loop. For each name in our `wordlist`, do the following steps.

## Creating the URL

```python
        url = f"http://{sub}.{domain}"
```

- **What It Does**: This line takes a name from the list and the main website name to make a complete web address (`url`).

## Trying to Visit the URL

```python
        try:
            response = requests.get(url, timeout=3)
```

- **What It Does**: This line tries to visit the web address. We wait up to 3 seconds for an answer.

## Checking if the Visit Was Successful

```python
            if response.status_code == 200:
```

- **What It Does**: This line checks if we could visit the website successfully.

## Printing and Storing Found Subdomains

```python
                print(f"Found: {url}")
                found_subdomains.append(url)
```

- **What It Does**: If successful, we print out "Found" and the website address. We also put the address in our box (`found_subdomains`).

## Handling Errors

```python
        except (requests.ConnectionError, requests.Timeout):
            pass  # Do nothing if the subdomain does not respond or times out
```

- **What It Does**: If we can't visit the website or if it takes too long, we do nothing and move on to the next name in the list.

## Returning the Results

```python
    return found_subdomains
```

- **What It Does**: At the end, our tool gives back the box of website addresses it could visit.

## Sample Wordlist and Domain

```python
wordlist = ['www', 'blog', 'mail', 'dev', 'shop', 'forum', 'app']
domain = "example.com"
```

- **What It Does**: These lines set up a test. We have a small list (`wordlist`) and a main website name (`domain`) to try our tool on.

## Running the Function

```python
find_subdomains(domain, wordlist)
```

- **What It Does**: Finally, this line uses the tool. It will print out the sub-websites it can find for the main website.
