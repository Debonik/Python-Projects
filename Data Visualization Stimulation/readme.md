# Description of the Code
## Here's what the code does:

* The **generate_data function** uses the Faker library to generate a list of random names, and uses the random.randint function to generate random marks (between 50 and 100) in three subjects for the given number of students.

* The **plot_histogram function** takes the generated data and creates a histogram for each subject using **plt.hist**. The alpha parameter is used to set the transparency level (so that overlapping parts of the histograms are visible). A legend is created using **plt.legend** and the axes are labelled using **plt.xlabel** and **plt.ylabel**. The histogram is displayed with **plt.show()**.

* The data is generated and plotted by calling the **generate_data** and **plot_histogram** functions at the end of the script.

* The resulting plot gives an overview of how students in the class are performing in the three subjects.
