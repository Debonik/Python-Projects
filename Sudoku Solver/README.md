# Sudoku Solver Explanation

This code snippet is a simple implementation of a Sudoku solver in Python. It uses a backtracking algorithm to solve a Sudoku puzzle.

```python
def is_valid(board, row, col, num):
```
Defines a function `is_valid` that checks if a number `num` can be placed at the position `(row, col)` on the `board` without violating Sudoku rules.

```python
    for i in range(9):
        if board[row][i] == num:
            return False
```
Loops through the row to check if the number `num` already exists. If it does, it returns `False`.

```python
    for i in range(9):
        if board[i][col] == num:
            return False
```
Loops through the column to check if the number `num` already exists. If it does, it returns `False`.

```python
    start_row = (row // 3) * 3
    start_col = (col // 3) * 3
```
Calculates the starting indices of the 3x3 subgrid that `(row, col)` belongs to.

```python
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            if board[start_row + i][start_col + j] == num:
                return False
```
Loops through the 3x3 subgrid to check if `num` already exists. If it does, it returns `False`.

```python
    return True
```
If `num` does not violate any rules, it returns `True`, meaning `num` can be placed at `(row, col)`.

```python
def solve_sudoku(board):
```
Defines the function `solve_sudoku` that attempts to solve the Sudoku puzzle using backtracking.

```python
    for row in range(9):
        for col in range(9):
```
Loops through each cell in the Sudoku board.

```python
            if board[row][col] == 0:
```
Checks if the current cell is empty (denoted by `0`).

```python
                for num in range(1, 10):
                    if is_valid(board, row, col, num):
```
Tries placing numbers `1` to `9` in the empty cell and checks if the placement is valid.

```python
                        board[row][col] = num
```
If valid, places the number `num` in the cell.

```python
                        if solve_sudoku(board):
                            return True
```
Recursively attempts to solve the rest of the board. If the board can be solved, it returns `True`.

```python
                        board[row][col] = 0
```
If placing `num` in the cell does not lead to a solution, it resets the cell (backtracks) and tries the next number.

```python
                return False
```
If no number can be placed in the cell, it returns `False`, triggering backtracking.

```python
    return True
```
If every cell has been filled correctly, it returns `True`, indicating the puzzle is solved.

```python
def print_board(board):
```
Defines a function `print_board` to display the Sudoku board.

```python
    for row in range(9):
        for col in range(9):
            print(board[row][col], end=" ")
        print()
```
Loops through the board and prints each number, formatting the board for display.

```python
board = [...]
```
Initializes a Sudoku board with some cells filled and others as `0` (representing empty cells).

```python
if solve_sudoku(board):
    print("Sudoku solved:")
    print_board(board)
else:
    print("No solution exists for the given Sudoku board.")
```
Calls `solve_sudoku` on the board and prints the solved board if a solution is found, otherwise prints a message stating no solution exists.
